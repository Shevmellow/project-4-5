# Project 4 of 5.

***

I'm learning how to do small projects as part of the [Result school](https://result.school/) marathon.

Here I learned how to create mini-games from the board and colored squares.
The Math.random principle in JavaScript and the hover pseudo-selector in css were used to dynamically create elements.

Colors were take in [Colours.cafe](https://www.instagram.com/colours.cafe/)
